# HackerNews Clone in Elm

This project is a **HackerNews clone** built using the **Elm programming language**, showcasing the power of functional programming and the Elm Architecture. It dynamically fetches and displays a list of posts from the HackerNews API, offering various features for customization and interactivity.

## Features

- **Customize the View**
  - Filter posts by type (e.g., job posts, text-only posts).
  - Adjust the number of posts displayed per page.

- **Sort Posts**
  - Sort posts based on criteria such as **score** or **date posted**.

- **Relative Timestamps**
  - Display how long ago each post was submitted in a human-readable format (e.g., "2 days ago").

- **Dynamic Data Loading**
  - Posts are fetched and rendered dynamically.
  - The application gracefully manages loading states.

## Highlights

This project demonstrates:
- **Functional Programming Principles**:
  - Immutability and pure functions.
  - Declarative data transformations using Elm's `List` and `Maybe` utilities.
- **Elm Architecture**:
  - A clean separation of model, view, and update functions.
  - Handling dynamic updates with structured state management.
- **Interactive User Interface**:
  - Simple, intuitive controls for filtering, sorting, and displaying data.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
